# Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm is one of the most famous algos out there
# If you're given a graph with weighted edges and was tasked to find the shortest path from one node to another than dijkstra's algo is one of the best options you have
#  the algo uses a minheap in order to continously pick the shortest path to the target destination
