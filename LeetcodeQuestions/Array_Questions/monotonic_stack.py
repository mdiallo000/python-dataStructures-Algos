class Solution:
    def isMonotonic(self, nums: List[int]) -> bool:
        #  so we are given an array of integers, only positive integers, no floating point values. We want to determine whether or not this list is either monotonically increasing or decreasing.
        #  What shoudl my approach be?
        #  NOT sure if there is a silver bullet for this problem. We have to our disposal a couple of patterns
