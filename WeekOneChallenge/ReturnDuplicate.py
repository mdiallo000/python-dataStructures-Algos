# Given an array of integers nums containing n + 1 integers where each integer is in the range [1, n] inclusive.

# There is only one repeated number in nums, return this repeated number.

# You must solve the problem without modifying the array nums and uses only constant extra space.

class Solution:
    def findDuplicate(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        mySet = ()
        for elem in nums:
            if elem not in mySet:
                mySet.add(elem)
            else:
                return elem
